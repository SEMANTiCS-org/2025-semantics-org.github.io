The rapid rise of generative and agentic AI is increasingly involving the semantic technologies community, opening an exciting new chapter for the field. This emerging era is marked by systems that integrate both symbolic and subsymbolic approaches in what are often called neurosymbolic solutions. In this new context, semantic technologies such as knowledge graphs and ontologies are not just relevant but essential. They provide a transparent, interpretable, and verifiable layer of structured knowledge that is critical for developing robust and practical AI applications across a wide range of domains.

While large language models (LLMs) excel at pattern recognition and language generation, they often struggle with consistency, traceability, and domain-specific reasoning. Semantic technologies can address these challenges by grounding AI in curated, structured knowledge that reflects expert understanding. This combination enables AI systems to be not only more intelligent but also more accountable and trustworthy.

As SEMANTICS 2025 will highlight, the fusion of semantic technologies with generative AI opens new opportunities for innovation in areas such as data integration, explainable AI, intelligent agents, and knowledge-centric applications in industry, science, and public policy. The conference will explore how ontologies, taxonomies, and knowledge graphs can play a central role in building the next generation of AI systems that are not only powerful but also transparent, fair, and sustainable.

## Main trends emerging from SEMANTICS 2025 Programme

SEMANTiCS 2025 will gather leading figures from academia and industry for three days of inspiring presentations, interactive workshops, and tutorials dedicated to exploring the latest advances in semantic technologies. The programme begins with a full day of workshops and tutorials designed to offer participants hands-on experience and an in-depth understanding of emerging trends in the field. A key highlight will be the **DBpedia Day** , where the global community behind this influential open knowledge extraction initiative will present recent updates and insights into converting resources such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons into high-quality Linked Open Data.

A diverse array of **eight workshops** will address some of the most pressing challenges and innovative directions currently shaping the semantic landscape. These sessions will cover scalable methods for constructing and maintaining large-scale knowledge graphs, improving industrial transparency through standardized semantic approaches, and exploring the convergence of neural and symbolic artificial intelligence. Significant attention will also be directed towards enhancing user interactions with semantic systems, effective governance and management of semantic data, and understanding the increasingly pivotal role played by LLMs in semantic infrastructures. The programme further includes **four tutorials** designed to equip participants with practical skills in utilizing state-of-the-art semantic technologies. Companies such as Graphwise and Metaphacts will showcase their advanced platforms and demonstrate how their solutions facilitate the creation of robust, enterprise-grade knowledge graphs. Additional tutorials will explore sophisticated strategies for integrating streaming data within semantic architectures and preparing knowledge graphs to act as foundational layers for AI-driven applications.

At the core of SEMANTiCS 2025 are two intellectually stimulating days, featuring 42 presentations organized across 12 thematic sessions. The programme strikes a careful balance between foundational research and cutting-edge applications, emphasizing particularly the innovative intersection between semantic technologies and generative AI. A distinctive feature of SEMANTiCS is also the close and productive synergy between pure research efforts and real-world industry implementations.

The community continues to strengthen fundamental technologies such as **RDF** and **SPARQL**, thereby consolidating the essential tools for effective data modelling and querying. Concurrently, ongoing research continues to enhance key areas such as **ontology development**, **reasoning**, and sophisticated methods of **knowledge representation**. These foundational technologies have proven indispensable across numerous domains, including healthcare, finance, and digital humanities.

A particularly noteworthy trend in this year's programme is the accelerating integration of **knowledge graphs** with **LLMs**. This fusion creates powerful **synergies between structured symbolic knowledge and deep learning**. Two complementary directions characterize this evolution. Firstly, knowledge graphs significantly enhance the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of LLM-driven systems. For instance, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches utilize knowledge graphs as reliable and context-rich sources, effectively reducing hallucinations and ensuring accurate, factual grounding. Secondly, large language models are increasingly employed to automatically build, enrich, and harmonize knowledge graphs at scale. This ability significantly reduces the manual effort traditionally required for KG maintenance and enables more scalable and up-to-date knowledge infrastructures. Additionally, these models support ontology generation and refinement, assisting in tasks such as concept extraction, taxonomy creation, and aligning new data with established vocabularies. Both of these directions are well represented in our programme, with a number of research groups and industry partners presenting innovative work that explores how best to combine these technologies. In particular, these hybrid approaches are increasingly being adopted to tackle well-established tasks such as **information extraction, data integration**, and **link prediction** in novel ways, demonstrating their potential to outperform methods based solely on symbolic reasoning or neural architectures.

Research and industry contributions related to these topics are structured into the following thematic sessions:
- Knowledge Graphs (covered in two dedicated sessions)
- Querying Knowledge Graphs
- LLMs and KGs
- Embeddings and Link Prediction
- Ontologies and Reasoning
- Semantic Data Management
- Data Integration
- Information Extraction
- Industry Meets Academia
- RDF and Linked Data
- Data Modeling and Interoperability

Overall, SEMANTiCS 2025 offers a timely opportunity to examine the ongoing development of semantic technologies and their increasing integration into the broader field of artificial intelligence. As AI systems grow more dependent on structured knowledge to support reasoning, explainability, and interoperability, semantic technologies are becoming fundamental building blocks of intelligent applications. Participants can expect to gain insight into state-of-the-art methods, innovative tools, and successful deployment strategies, as well as to identify emerging trends and collaborative opportunities. SEMANTiCS 2025 thus plays a key role in shaping the next generation of AI systems grounded in structured, explainable, and interoperable knowledge.
