# Large Language Model Policy

SEMANTICS 2025 follows the guidelines of the community about the fair use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and borrows the policy from the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM).

The underlying policy pertains to all the conference tracks and papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT or Bing, are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. In essence, the policy expects the following:

-   The Large Language Model (LLM) policy for SEMANTICS 2025 prohibits text produced entirely by LLMs (i.e., “generated”). This does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing the author-written text.
-   The LLM policy is largely predicated on the principle of being conservative with respect to guarding against potential issues of using LLMs, including plagiarism.
-   The LLM policy applies to SEMANTICS 2025. We expect this policy to evolve in future conferences as we better understand LLMs and their impacts on scientific publishing.
