# Posters and Demos
<p  style="text-align: justify !important;">
The Posters & Demos Track provides a platform for researchers to present their latest findings, ongoing projects, and cutting-edge work in progress. This track is open to a range of submissions on innovative applications, the latest results, unpublished ideas, prototypes of semantic technologies, and their use in various domains. It also welcomes contributions related to applications, use cases, and datasets that may attract developers and potential research or business partners. The Posters & Demos Track offers an informal setting that promotes engagement and dialogue between presenters and attendees. These discussions can provide valuable feedback for presenters' future work, while also allowing participants to gain insight into emerging research trends and network with other researchers.

## Topics of Interest
We welcome contributions in the context of semantic-based research and systems, which address – but are not limited to – 
the topics of the [Research Track](https://2024-eu.semantics.cc/page/cfp_rev_rep). 
Additionally, we encourage submissions of visionary ideas, position statements, negative results, and unconventional ideas.

Demos should showcase innovative implementations and technologies both, from academia and industry. We warmly welcome contributions from industry professionals, provided that they concentrate on introducing innovative solutions to particular challenges, rather than serving as promotional material or descriptions of commercial products.


## Author Guidelines and Submission
<p  style="text-align: justify !important;">
Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper that describes the work, its contribution to the field or innovative aspects.

* Poster and demo submissions are at most 5 pages long, including references.
* No double-blind submissions required.
* Submissions must be either in PDF or HTML.
* Submissions must be formatted in the style of CEUR-ART (https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html). An Overleaf page for LaTeX users is available.
* For demos, we ask authors to include links enabling the reviewers to test the application or review the component. The absence of a pointer affects the overall rating of the contribution.
* Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere.
* At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper.


__We look forward to receiving your contributions!__
